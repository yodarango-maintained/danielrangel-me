            It seems as if Esau,
            the carnal man, was your typical I-can-do-it-all, handsome-looking,
            talented, athletic, rugged kid. While, Jacob, Jacob on the other hand,
            perhaps had not much going for him. Nevertheless, even if Jacob's
            intentions were not right at the time, we can perceive in him a desire
            for the spiritual matters due to how early in the years of his life—some
            scholars say he was around 17 years of age—he demands the blessing
            from Esau. 
            <br />
            <br />
            With Esau being his father's favorite, and Isaac being the
            only one who could pass forth the blessing to the next generation, we
            can imagine the agony Jacob grew up with wishing he could what the first
            born had. Not only was his brother Esau better at everything He did,
            but he also had the right to the blessing.
