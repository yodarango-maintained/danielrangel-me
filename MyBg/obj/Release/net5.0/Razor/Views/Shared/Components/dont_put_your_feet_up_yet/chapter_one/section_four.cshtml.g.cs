         Jacob, with his mother's help takes matters into his own hands and snatches the blessing from his brother Esau. The bible says 
            that Rebekah was told—probably by Divine intervention as when she was told about their future—that Esau planned to kill 
            Jacob once Isaac died in consequence of what Jacob  had done to him. Rebekah tells Jacob to go hide in Harran with her brother
            Laban until Esau's fury subsides. It is quite sad, but we never see in the Bible Jacob embracing his mother again. 
            Apparently Esau's anger lasted longer than they both bargained for. That, my friend, is exactly what sin does. ");

            Oh! How many families, marriages, friendships and sweet relationships have been ruined just because a party has chosen to act
            in a selfish way. When God promises something He will always bring it to completion, there is no reason to get ahead of Him. 
            When we do, we will find that we are only hurting ourselves.
