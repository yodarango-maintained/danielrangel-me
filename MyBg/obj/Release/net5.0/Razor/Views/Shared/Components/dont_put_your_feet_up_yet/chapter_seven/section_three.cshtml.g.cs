            changes in his own sons. They regret what they have done to their brother Joseph. Not realizing it was joseph that was selling

            Father, mother if your kids are
            grown and you think it’s too late to educate them and set an example for them, it is never too late. God is timeless therefore
            with God it could never be too late. Let me get a little personal here my parents did not start living for Christ until I was
            in my teenage years. All the crucial years of instruction when I was a child were lost.

            Their heads are now gray and I am a 26
            year-old married man living 32 hours away from them, and do you know what? They still keep setting an example for me. They still
            keep guiding me. I still call them to have their input about decisions I’m about to take. With Christ is never too late to gain
            your children, as long as there is life there is hope.
