            Jacob is about to be Israel—God's man, and that is how God shapes his men and women: it is through pain, errors, and suffering
            that God shows us the perfection of His ways and the imperfection of ours.

            Alan Redpath says that ""When God wants an impossible
            kind of Job done He usually gets and impossible kind of person, smashes them, and then uses them. God has to crush you into
            pieces before He can make you whole. God's heroes are not Marvel's definition of heroes. You can stay looking a cute boy or girl,
            very well put together and never amount to a penny with God. But if you want to be used remember that God's people are marked by
            spiritual scars and bruises.
            <br />
            <br />
            God wants rugged men and women that know how to spiritually fight and not a bunch
            of Sissy's that will run away at the first sign of danger.
