            The end of days for Jacob has almost approached. And before it does, he wants to make sure that he blesses Jospeh's sons, but

            your voice gets more quiet every day. But yet, look back at your life and say, The Lord has been my shepherd. He made me lie 
            down in green pastures, he led me beside quiet waters, He has always refreshed my soul...
