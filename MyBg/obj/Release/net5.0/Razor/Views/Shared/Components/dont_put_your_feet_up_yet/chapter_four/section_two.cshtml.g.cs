            Laban has been persecuting Jacob, and due to Jacob's wives and small children , he caught up to him quickly. When Laban complains
            to Jacob for running away,  Jacob, now at 96 years of age, looks back to his 20 years at Haran and describes his experience with
            Laban. Cold, heat, and mistreatments are the charges he brings against Him. I don’t know about you, Jacob but the far country
            does not sound to fun.
