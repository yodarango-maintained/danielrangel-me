            Not only did Jacob and Rebekah differed in their viewpoint about the children, but it might appear as if communication among
            them might not have been the greatest. It was very probable that Rebekah had told Isaac about God's desire for the children,
            that the oldest would serve the youngest

            Yet Jacob chooses to go against God and His wife, and in return his
            wife goes against him and over his word by deceiving Isaac. It is no wonder where this boy Jacob got his training for cheating.
