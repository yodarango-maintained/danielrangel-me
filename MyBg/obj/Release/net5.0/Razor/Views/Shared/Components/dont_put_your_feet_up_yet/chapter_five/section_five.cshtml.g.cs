            Jacob and Esau have met once again. It is quite shocking, but we see some changes on the character of old carnal Esau too. He has let go of that
            grudge that he held against Jacob and has quite welcomed him. Esau, the carnal man, invites him to live with him in Seir. Nevertheless
            Jacob decides that he does not want to go where the flesh leads, but neither does he want to go all the way to Bethel, where God has
            called Him. So instead, he resolves he is going to stay in Succoth.

            He is just going to stay in the middle and offer an altar there

            After all, what is the difference of offering an altar in Sukkoth or one in Bethel, right? He, once again, is going to
            serve God on his own terms. He is going to live in the middle and sadly, at a very high cost. Oh the pain that we could save ourselves
            from if we just went through with God’s plan all the way, and not just stay in the middle. Once again, we will see how colossal of a
            price Jocob has to pay for staying in the Middle.
