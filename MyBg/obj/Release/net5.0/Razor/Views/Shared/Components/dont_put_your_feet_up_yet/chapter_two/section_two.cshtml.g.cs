            Just as God
            presented to Jacob his three promises, Jacob responds to God with three petitions:
            <br />
            <br />

            <ul class=""std-ul"">
                <li>God's protection</li>
                <li>Mate");
            WriteLiteral(@"rial Possession</li>
                <li>Safe Return</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            </p>

        <p class=""std-p"">
            Did you notice that he not only altered the order of the promises, but he removed one? The list Jacob gives back to God does
            not include the promise about being a blessing to others. Why? Because that is who Jacob is. He could not care less about
            others. After all, he just cheated his own brother and father, what makes us think that he would care about somebody else?
            He is saying to God, God I like your plan, but how about we make a few amendments to it. How about we remove that part about
            being a blessing to others and insert a safe return instead? After all I have gotten my blessing, who cares if anybody else
            has theirs. God will never push anyone into doing His will.
            <br />
            <br />

            Holy Spirit always leading but never pushing nor drawing. When we insist in having our own terms, God will lets us have them,
