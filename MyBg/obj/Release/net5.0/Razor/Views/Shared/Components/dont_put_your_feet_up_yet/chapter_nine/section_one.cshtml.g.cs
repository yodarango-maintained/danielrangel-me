            This verse perhaps speaks the loudest to our dear elderly saints, who can
            look back in their lives and see the many times they let God, themselves, and those they love down, but they can also look at the
            present and glorify God for His goodness and working all things for their good at the end and keeping them through their long journey
            in life. For, surely the end of a live is more important than its beginning
