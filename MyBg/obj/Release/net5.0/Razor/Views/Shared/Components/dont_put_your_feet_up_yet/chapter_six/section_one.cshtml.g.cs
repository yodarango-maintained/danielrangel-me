            Not too long after Jacob resolved to stay in the middle, his precious daughter Dinah becomes a victim of rape and in vengeance,
            her two brothers, Simeon and Levi slaughter the entire city of Sachem. These were the very two kids that were placed in front of
            Joseph and Rachel when he was getting ready to meet Esau. The same kids of the woman who Jacob, in my opinion, never really
            loved.
            <br />
            <br />
            Clearly, the poor parenthood of Jacob towards them affected the character of these two boys. Notice how they make sure to
            remark to Jacob “should OUR sister…” and not “should YOUR daughter...” in
            <span class=""underlined-text""
                  onclick=""displayBibleVerse('Genesis 34:31',
           ");
            WriteLiteral(@" '31 But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”')"">Genesis 34:31.</span>
            They are implying that perhaps Jacob
            did not care much for the kids of them, therefore they had to defend their sister since her father would not.
