            his life, Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban. Such wells during those days tended to have a huge stone that served as a

            The reason for which a schedule
            was set in place to water the sheep in those days was due to the dryness of the land and the scarcity of water. High
            temperatures would cause water to evaporate quickly. It is also stated by many commentators, that not every person had this
            right to remove the stone, but rather a designated person would be put in charge of this task to have a more rigid control
            of the system.
