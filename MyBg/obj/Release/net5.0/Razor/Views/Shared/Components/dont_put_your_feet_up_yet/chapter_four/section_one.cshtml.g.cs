            We now find Jacob on the running once again, only this time away from uncle Laban. Just as God had seen Jacob when he was running

            quite intriguing: ""I am the God of Bethel where YOU promised me...""

            <br />
            It is my personal opinion that God is reminding Jacob that it was
            not His will that he went through all of this. God does not tell Jacob, ""Bethel is the place where I promised you,"" but rather
            ""the place where you promised me."" God is reminding Jacob that He is the God of Bethel but that it was not on His terms that Jacob had
            left Bethel the first time, but rather on Jacob's terms.
            <br />
            <br />
            It was Jacob who set the terms on the contract and God just allowed him to
            have what he wanted. Sometimes God simply lets you have what you want so that you realize you don't actually want what you have.
