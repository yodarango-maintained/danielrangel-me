            After Jacob unintentionally marries Leah, he agrees to work another seven years for Rachel. Therefore we know that he has been in
            Harran for at least 14 years by now. Jacob, has been treated quite ugly by uncle Laban. He has cheated him, overworked him,
            lied to him, and what not; he really has been putting this man to School. Jacob, seeing his current situation, attempts to
            leave uncle Laban's. The far country is not so fun no more. Jacob really thought he was going to have the time of his life
            finally away from home and continue to make his own rules, but turns out things are a little different in the far country than
            what he thought. He thought he was going to get by with his actions but reality has just slapped him in the face.

            promises again, offering him what we know he is not willing to give. ""Name your wages,"" says Laban, ""and I will pay it."" This is the
