            What should attract most of our attention from this passage, however, it is the words of verse 10: ""Jacob blessed Pharaoh."" 
            Jacob, as every mature and grateful Christian, finds himself bearing witness for God everywhere he goes. It is hard to shut 
            the voice of a grateful Soul. Show me someone who cannot stop talking about God and mentioning the beautiful name of Jesus 
            Christ and I will show you someone who has been snatched from the deepest places of hell. Do not get too surprised if some 
            Christians are not very demonstrative in their worship. If they clock in and out without ever touching a single soul with the 
            gospel at the work place. If they worship is dull and seldom during church service.
