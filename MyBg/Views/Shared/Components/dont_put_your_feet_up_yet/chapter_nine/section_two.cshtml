        'After this, Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. ' +
        '2) And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed. ' +
        '3) And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty[a] appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, ' +
        '4) and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’ ' +
        '5) And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. ' +
        '6) And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. ' +
        '7) As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”' + 
        '8 When Israel saw Joseph\'s sons, he said, “Who are these?” ' +
        '9) Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.” ' +
        '10) Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. ' +
        '11) And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” ' +
        '12) Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. ' +
        '13) And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel\'s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel\'s right hand, and brought them near him. ' +
        '14) And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn).' + 
        '15) And he blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,')">

            The end of days for Jacob has almost approached. And before it does, he wants to make sure that he blesses Jospeh's sons, but 
            not without sharing his testimony first. Once again, the new man, Israel has found an opportunity to glorify God and testify 
            of His goodness. Nevertheless, the sweetest words of the chapter perhaps come wrapped in verse 15, "The Lord has been my 
            shepherd."  Some hundreds of years later a rugged shepherd king by the name of David would say similar words Psalm 23:1, but 
            before he wrote those words, papaw had already coined the phrase. This rugged old man knew something about being shepherd by 
            his Lord.

            I wonder how wonderful must be to come to the place in your life where you see your head going gray; and those knees 
            that once touched and raised so easily from the floor lose their strength. To see light get dimmer and dimmer, and realize 
            your voice gets more quiet every day. But yet, look back at your life and say, The Lord has been my shepherd. He made me lie 
            down in green pastures, he led me beside quiet waters, He has always refreshed my soul...
