    '39) What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. ' +
    '40) There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. ' +
    '41) These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. ' +

            Laban has been persecuting Jacob, and due to Jacob's wives and small children , he caught up to him quickly. When Laban complains
            to Jacob for running away,  Jacob, now at 96 years of age, looks back to his 20 years at Haran and describes his experience with
            Laban. Cold, heat, and mistreatments are the charges he brings against Him. I don’t know about you, Jacob but the far country
            does not sound to fun.
            <br />
            <br />
            Anyone who falls in the traps of sin can look back and testify that it the far country was not so fun
            after all. It was quite great at first, while you did not have to eat and swim in the mud with the swine, but it gets very stinky
            and messy quite fast over there.
            <br />
            <br />
            Twenty years later and Jacob still feels empty. If you are a true child of God it is impossible
            for you to ever be happy in sin. You are a child of God, your place is in the Father's house, only pigs are happy in the dung.
