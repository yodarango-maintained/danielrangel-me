            Now Jacob is eating the fruit from the tree that he planted. This is a very important principle that we see in scripture:
            the law of sowing and reaping
            <span class="underlined-text"
                  onclick="displayBibleVerse('Galatians 6:7',
            '7) Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.')">Galatians 6:7.</span>
            Although God forgives heals and restores, He does not nullify his own Laws.

            If
            a person was a murdered and got saved in prison, chances are He won’t send an angel in the middle of the night to deliver
            him/ her. If a person had children out of wedlock, the children will not disappear after coming to Christ. If anyone is in
            an abyss of financial debt because of reckless spending, the debt will still have to paid. If a person had illicit sex before
            marriage, it will have an impact on future relationships.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jacob has come to bethel, but He is still paying for the mistakes
            from long ago. He cheated his father with a dead animal and now he his children have followed in his steps. Another important
            point to notice in verse 32 is how in contrast to
            <span class="underlined-text"
                  onclick="displayBibleVerse('Genesis 34:31',
            '31) But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”')">Genesis 34:31, </span>
            where Levi and Simeon refer to Dinah as “our sister” the
            children now refer to Joseph as “your son” another hint that they were perhaps pointing out Jacob’s favoritism towards Joseph.
